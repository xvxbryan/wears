I am the Senior Engineer at Wears, a Start Up company I helped start in 2020 and has had my full time commitment ever since. Wears is a sneaker rental community dedicated to revolutionizing the sneaker industry by making high-quality sneakers accessible without the high costs.
I created Wears using React for the frontend in order to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. On the back end I use Node.JS with the Express framework to build our APIs, which interact with our MySQL database to manage and retrieve data efficiently.
Wears uses Authorize.net and Stripe to handle payment and bank transfers.
Asside from creating the member side, I also created the employee dashboard where we can handle things such as New Orders, Order Status, Rental Debrief/Maintenace, Publish Products, Error Log, and more.

I cannot provide the source code as Wears is a privately owned company and the code is not open-source but I am more than willing to demo any portion of the member side.
